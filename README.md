# Homework-1-Code-Refactor

** Homework to learn how to make html to look organized with semantics, using proper tags to make more efficient for ccs and other tools to be used.

1. Created new repository named "Homeowkr-1-Code-Refactor" from Github, cloned to my computer.

2. Created "index.html" , "style.css" files.

3. With provided template, removed non-sematic HTML tags replaced with sematics tags.

4. Added alt tag to each images.

5. All changed I made had been pushed to git to update my repository.

Thank you!
